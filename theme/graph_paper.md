The `graph_paper` theme features a subtle graph paper-like background with dark text mixed with white elements (e.g., code blocks or block quotes). The [Work Sans](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans) font family is imported and utilized to enhance the visual appeal and readability of the text.
