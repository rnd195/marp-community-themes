The `academic` theme features a clean design with a maroon ribbon on top. Additionally, it leverages the Markdown blockquote syntax (e.g., `> text`) to enable footnotes. The theme imports [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans+JP/about) with support for Japanese and [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro).
