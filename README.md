# Marp Community Themes

This is a community-maintained theme gallery for [Marp](https://marp.app/). For more information about how to create themes for Marp, see the official [documentation](https://marpit.marp.app/theme-css).

The website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and it is based on the [Showcase](https://github.com/apvarun/showcase-hugo-theme) theme made by [apvarun](https://github.com/apvarun/). It is also greatly inspired by the Typora [theme gallery](https://theme.typora.io/). The [Inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter) font family by [rsms](https://github.com/rsms/) is used as the main font.

Feel free to provide any suggestions in the issues tab.

# Installation / Usage

After clicking the "Download CSS" button on any theme's page, your browser likely loads the `.css` file instead of downloading it. You can either locally save the `.css` file using `Ctrl + S` or you may copy the URL for further use (see below).

### Marp for VS Code Extension

1. Open Settings in VSCode (`Ctrl + ,`)
2. Search for `markdown.marp.themes`
3. Add a URL or a local path to the `.css` file
   - URL example: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rnd195/marp-community-themes/main/themes/theme_name.css`
   - Local path example: `./assets/theme_name.css` (theme needs to be somewhere in the project's directory)

4. Enable the theme in the front-matter of the Markdown document

```
---
marp: true
theme: theme_name
---
```

### Marp CLI

1. Put the `.css` theme file in the directory of your Markdown document
2. Use the `--theme` parameter during the export and specify the path to the `.css` file
   - e.g.: `marp --theme ./assets/theme_name.css document.md -o document.pdf`



# Submitting themes

1. Fill out the [submission template](https://github.com/rnd195/marp-community-themes/blob/main/template/submission_template.md) with all the necessary information. Don't forget to add screenshots and a thumbnail.
2. Create a zip of all the generated files. This file should include:
   - Description of your theme in Markdown
   - CSS file of your theme
   - Assets folder with screenshots
   - Thumbnail folder with the thumbnail
3. Create an [issue](https://github.com/rnd195/marp-community-themes/issues), assign the `theme submission` label to it, and upload the zip file there.

See [issue #1](https://github.com/rnd195/marp-community-themes/issues/1) for a complete submission example.

Once your submission is reviewed and accepted, the files related to your theme will reside in the [`website/content/`](https://github.com/rnd195/marp-community-themes/tree/main/website/content) directory and the CSS file will be in the [`themes/`](https://github.com/rnd195/marp-community-themes/tree/main/themes) directory. 

Updates to your screenshots, Markdown files, or the CSS file should be preferably done through pull requests.

By submitting the theme, you acknowledge that you are the author of the submitted files. It is also important to adequately indicate the usage and the source of any third-party resources (e.g., code, pictures, and so on). Please, use an [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) or a [GPL-Compatible license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses) for your themes and link to the license in the front-matter of your theme's Markdown file.
