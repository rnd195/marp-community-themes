After clicking the "Download CSS" button on any theme's page, your browser likely loads the `.css` file instead of downloading it. You can save the `.css` file locally using `Ctrl + S`.

### Marp for VS Code Extension

1. Open Settings in VSCode (`Ctrl + ,`)
2. Search for `markdown.marp.themes`
3. Add a URL or a local path to the `.css` file
   - URL: refer to [this discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17341122/link-and-execute-external-javascript-file-hosted-on-github/) about linking to files on GitHub
   - Local path example: `./assets/theme_name.css` (theme needs to be somewhere in the project's directory)

4. Enable the theme in the front-matter of the Markdown document, i.e., write the following at the very beginning of the Markdown document:

```
---
marp: true
theme: theme_name
---
```

For additional settings (such as `size` or `paginate`), follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/blob/main/website/docs/guide/directives.md).

### Marp CLI

1. Put the `.css` theme file in the directory of your Markdown document
2. Use the `--theme` parameter during the export and specify the path to the `.css` file
   - e.g.: 
   
```
marp --theme ./assets/theme_name.css document.md -o document.pdf
```
